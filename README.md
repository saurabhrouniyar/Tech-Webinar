# React + Vite

📌 Project Title

Tech Career Webinar – Landing Page

📄 Project Description

I have designed and developed a UI-based landing page for a tech career webinar using React.js and Tailwind CSS. The main focus of this project is to create a clean, modern, and visually appealing user interface to showcase webinar information.

The website presents key details such as event information, speakers, and a call-to-action in a structured and easy-to-understand layout. Subtle animations and hover effects are used to enhance the overall look and user experience.
